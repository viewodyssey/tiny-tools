To reach the snacks, the animals take turns jumping off of an overhead ledge and down on to a see-saw, propelling the other animal up and, ideally, intercepting the path of a flying sausage, bone or fish.  (Bonus points for catching two at once!)  The player has a small degree of mobility for the animals, adjusting their lateral position with mouse movements, but mostly the strategy entirely revolves around the best moment to time the jump so one animal snags a food item on the way down while the other pet gets a bite to eat on the way up.  A time meter continually counts down, but is somewhat replenished by food.",

Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller Titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind.",

The game handles it differently compared to the original storyline in the comic books, continuing the narrative of the first game (and especially the DLC The City That Never Sleeps) where Miles Morales is bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider and gained powers similar to Peter Parker's. Miles trains under Parker and is still integrating in the role of a Spider-Man. In the game Parker does not die, but leaves to join his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson to cover a civil war, leaving Miles as the only webslinger in New York. The story focuses on the campaign of his mother Rio Morales, and the defense of his home neighborhood in Harlem and New York City against a high-tech criminal army called the Underground and Roxxon Energy Corporation who are in a gang war.",

        "overview": "The Invisible Man is a Sci-Fi American television series starring Vincent Ventresca, Paul Ben-Victor, Eddie Jones, Shannon Kenny and Michael McCafferty. Somewhat more successful than previous television series involving invisible secret agents, it aired from June 9, 2000 to February 1, 2002, lasting two seasons.\n\nThe plot revolves around Darien Fawkes, a thief facing life imprisonment who was recruited by a low-rent spy organization and given the power of invisibility via implantation of a special \"Quicksilver gland\" in his head. The gland allows Fawkes to secrete a light-bending substance called \"Quicksilver\" from his pores and follicles. The substance quickly coats his skin, hair, nails and clothes and renders him invisible. He can consciously release the Quicksilver, which then flakes off and disintegrates. However, the Quicksilver gland was sabotaged at its creation by scientist Arnaud DeFehrn to release a neurotoxin that accumulates in the bloodstream and causes intense pain, followed by antisocial behavior and psychosis. The host requires regular doses of \"counteragent\" to keep him sane and healthy, which is controlled by said government agency. This series lasted for two seasons, before being cancelled due to cost issues and internal bickering between the Sci Fi Channel and its then-parent company, USA Networks. The show's first season ran concurrently in first-run syndication as well as on Sci Fi.",

It was animated at the Slightly Offbeat Productions Studios in Penrose, Auckland, New Zealand. Coming on the heels of the direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar, the series picked up where that installment left off, with Aladdin now living in the palace, engaged to beautiful and spunky Princess Jasmine. \"Al\" and Jasmine went together into peril among sorcerers, monsters, thieves, and more. Monkey sidekick Abu, the animated Magic Carpet, and the fast-talking, shape-shifting Genie came along to help, as did sassy, complaining parrot Iago, formerly Jafar\u2019s pet but now an antihero. Jafar, having previously been destroyed in the second movie, returns in only one episode which also serves as a crossover with Hercules: The Animated Series.",

Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller Titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind.",

The campaign follows the story of Iden Versio, leader of an Imperial special forces team known as Inferno Squad. You are who Stormtroopers call when they're in trouble, and Rebels know you well enough to fear you. As the story starts somewhere during Episode VI, after a couple of introductory missions you are dispatched on Endor, a satellite-moon where the shield array for the Death Star is, and Han Solo with a group of rebels is about to take it out so that Rebel X-Wings can attack the Death Star. You are too late and the Death Star is destroyed... and as we know from the movie, the Emperor along with it, even though Darth Vader killed him before the explosion, unknown to Iden. As a true believer in the Empire, Iden's plan is to avenge the Emperor and bring the Rebels to their knees.",
